# Step 1: Load datasets
businesses <- st_read("data/raw/osm_businesses.geojson", quiet = TRUE) %>%
  st_transform(4326) %>%
  st_make_valid()

census <- st_read("data/raw/richmond_census.geojson", quiet = TRUE) %>%

# Step 2: Spatial join â€” assign each business to its census tract
businesses_in_tracts <- st_join(businesses, census, join = st_within)

# Step 3: Count businesses per tract
business_counts <- businesses_in_tracts %>%
  st_drop_geometry() %>%
  group_by(GEOID) %>%

# Step 4: Merge counts with census data
dnoi_data <- census %>%
