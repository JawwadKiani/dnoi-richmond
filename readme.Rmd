## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have **R (version 4.0 or above)** and **RStudio** installed.

### Install Required R Packages

```r
install.packages(c(
  "shiny", "leaflet", "dplyr", "sf", "osmdata", 
  "tidycensus", "shinyWidgets", "here", "htmltools"
))
```

### Obtain Your Census API Key

To fetch US Census data dynamically, you must obtain your own Census API key:

- Visit [Census API Key Signup](https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html)  
- Register and get your API key via email  
- Activate your key by clicking the activation link in the email  

Set your key in R:

### Notes

- **Raw and processed data are not included** in this repository due to size and privacy considerations. You will need to source or generate these yourself or request access.  
- The app fetches some data dynamically from **OpenStreetMap** and the **US Census API**. Ensure your internet connection is active.  
- The **DNOI scoring weights** can be adjusted in the app code to fine-tune neighborhood opportunity evaluations.
